# XLink Kai script for XBMC4Xbox

## Working
- Joining arenas (not querying them, so all arenas have to be entered manually into either vectors.txt or faves.txt!)
- Joining favourite arenas for quick access to arenas you regularly play! (requires an entry in faves.txt)
- Setting your default Arena to the default "Arena" after a match!
- Viewing XLink Kai statistics

## Not Working
- Querying arenas (the API doesn't seem to support this, so all joining has to be done manually!)
- Showing additional user information
- Editing settings of any kind
